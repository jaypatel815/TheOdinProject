# Recipes
This project is a showcase of my HTML skills, featuring a collection of my favorite recipe. I designed it as a practical exercise to test my knowledge and build a solid foundation in HTML. I plan to revisit this project in the future to enhance its design with CSS and add interactive features using JavaScript.
