<p> Pav Bhaji is a beloved street food from Mumbai, India. It features a flavorful, spicy mixture of mashed vegetables paired with soft dinner rolls. The term "Pav" refers to the bread, while "Bhaji" means vegetables. The dish is seasoned with a unique spice mix called pav bhaji masala and is typically topped with generous amounts of butter and fresh cilantro.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> bhaji is made with mixed vegetables and the most commonly used vegetables in pav bhaji are potatoes, onions, green peppers, peas. Carrots, beets, beans are also commonly used.</li>
    <li><strong>Spices:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cumin seeds</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Pav bhaji masala:</strong> the main flavor in the bhaji comes from a special blend of spices known as pav bhaji masala. You can get it from Indian grocery store (like Patel Brothers).</li>
            <li><strong>Kashmiri red chili powder:</strong> this is added mainly for color. Do not confuse it with regular chili powder, this one isn't hot.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Butter:</strong> there's no good pav bhaji without lots of butter! I love using amul butter in my pav bhaji.</li>
    <li><strong>Tomato puree:</strong> along with fresh tomatoes, I also like adding some store bought tomato puree for extra flavor. I would highly recommend not skipping it.</li>
    <li><strong>Garnishes:</strong> to finish the pav bhaji, you would need a good squeeze of lemon juice and lots of cilantro.</li>
    <li><strong>Pav:</strong> eggless dinner rolls. You can find them at Indian grocery stores or you can also make them at home.</li>

<h2>How to Make Pav Bhaji - Step by Step Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Boil the veggies first and keep them ready.</li>
    <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and oil in a large pot on medium heat. Once the butter melts and oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle.</li>
    <li>Add chopped onions and mix. I like to use my food processor to chop them really fine.</li>
    <li>Cook the onions for around 4 minutes until golden brown in color. Add finely chopped ginger, garlic, and green chili. Cook for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Add chopped tomatoes and mix well. Let the tomatoes cook for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add tomato puree, 1/4 cup water and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cover the pan and let the tomato cook for 6 minutes until softened and completely cooked.</li>
    <li>Add the pav bhaji masala, Kashmiri red chili powder, red chili powder, and 1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
    <li>Stir in the boiled veggies and mix.</li>
    <li>Using a potato masher, mash the veggies until they are completely mixed with the masala.</li>
    <li>Add 3/4-1 cup of water and mix. Use an immersion blender to blend the veggies to a paste like consistency.</li>
    <li>Cover the pot and set heat to low. Let the bhaji simmer on low heat for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Open the pot and add in 2 tablespoons of butter.</li>
    <li>Add a generous amount of chopped cilantro.</li>
    <li>Then add in juice of 1 large lemon. Let the bhaji simmer for 2 more minutes and then remove pan from heat.</li>
    <li>To toast the pav, melt butter on a pan. Sprinkle some pav bhaji masala on top of the butter and then place the buns on the pan.</li>
    <li>Press to toast the pav until crisp and golden brown from both sides.</li>
